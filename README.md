# web pack starter kit with testing (jest)

## step 1: clone this repo

## rm -rf .git

## sync with new repo

## this is a basic setup for jest. It works with es6 syntax, by including a .babelrc file, which contains:

{
"env": {
"test": {
"plugins": ["@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs"]
}
}
}

## includes .babelrc, includes jest elements in the .eslintrc.json file. Also needs babel and jest as dependancies.

## all in all this is my webpack starterkit that includes jest.
